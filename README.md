# Advent of Code 2023
https://adventofcode.com/ is an event where every day for 25 days leading up to christmas, you get a challenge that should be solved using programming or similar tools.  

[Last year](https://github.com/percyqaz/AdventOfCode_2022) I took it as an excuse to use **a different tool or language each day**, some for the first time ever.  

Let's see what I feel up to doing this year, I do at least want to try out Ruby, and I end up slipping into Python for the hard problems near the end because it's just so easy to prototype and debug stuff in Python

## Day 11 Update

So far so good! I've used a different tool or language each day so far, including Ruby

Ruby is blessed and it was a delight using it when compared to everything else I've picked up (there was a day I used Perl and then gave up because it was so awful)

Prolog was disappointing for me as I thought it would be much more powerful and helpful than it actually was, however it has improved the way I think about certain problems

The highlight so far has been creating [DMS](https://github.com/percyqaz/DMS) for day 4 - It is an esoteric programming language for which the entire concept popped into my head on the 3rd. I intend on making a web-based interpreter and page so that you can try it for yourself, but a .NET-based executable interpreter exists at the moment

Days 15-25 I will be with family over Christmas so I will be switching to Python as I did last year, and solving the puzzles at my leisure as and when (probably before the new year)
