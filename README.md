# Advent of Code 2023
https://adventofcode.com/ is an event where every day for 25 days leading up to christmas, you get a challenge that should be solved using programming or similar tools. 

[Last year](https://github.com/percyqaz/AdventOfCode_2022) I took it as an excuse to use **a different tool or language each day**, some for the first time ever.   
This year I'm doing the same again, and like last year, from the 15th of December onwards I will be spending time with family - Puzzles after then will be done in Python as and when.

**All of these solutions are completely my own, without hints.** My only outside assistance has been Googling the documentation of the various languages, and some explanations from ChatGPT on the quirks of Prolog :)

## Day 11 Update

So far so good! I've used a different tool or language each day so far, including Ruby

Ruby is blessed and it was a delight using it when compared to everything else I've picked up

There was a day I used Perl and then gave up because it was so awful

Prolog was disappointing for me as I thought it would be much more powerful and helpful than it actually was, however it has improved the way I think about certain problems

The highlight for me so far has been creating [DMS](https://github.com/percyqaz/DMS) for day 4 - It is an esoteric programming language for which the entire concept popped into my head on the 3rd. You can [try it yourself here!](https://percyqaz.github.io/DMS)
