# Advent of Code 2023
https://adventofcode.com/ is an event where every day for 25 days leading up to christmas, you get a challenge that should be solved using programming or similar tools.  

[Last year](https://github.com/percyqaz/AdventOfCode_2022) I took it as an excuse to use **a different tool or language each day**, some for the first time ever.  

Let's see what I feel up to doing this year, I do at least want to try out Ruby, and I end up slipping into Python for the hard problems near the end because it's just so easy to prototype and debug stuff in Python
