To solve part 1, have the following processes running

`python3 serve1.py 1`
`python3 serve1.py 2`
`python3 serve1.py 3`
`python3 serve1.py 4`
`python3 serve1.py 5`
`python3 serve1.py 6`
`python3 serve1.py 7`

Then run `python3 part1.py`

Processes form a mesh network that solves the problem (doesn't do it especially different to a single file solution, I just wanted to prep a little bit for setting up a docker swarm or something on a later day)

For part 2, setup likewise with `serve2.py`, then run `part2.py`
