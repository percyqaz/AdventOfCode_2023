Solutions written in [DMS](https://github.com/percyqaz/DMS) - An esoteric language I made up on the night of day 3  
The moment I saw day 4 (particularly how the numbers on the cards were spaced) I knew it had to be implemented for this day's puzzle

I spent day 4 writing the DMS interpreter from a spec I drew up the night before, and then had such difficulty doing the problem I had to return to it after travelling for work

To run the solutions, use my [F# interpreter for the language](https://github.com/percyqaz/DMS) and run `dms --data input.txt part1.dms` and the same for `part2.dms`. The solution is printed to stdout

Read more about DMS from the link above (I may also create a site to try it out and fiddle around with it for your enjoyment)

Part 1 solved on the 6th of december, Part 2 finished on the 7th
