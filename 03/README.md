Part 1 solve achieved via ```gprolog --query-goal main --consult-file part1.pro```, pressing a and then waiting for all outputs (took half an hour on my machine)  
WSL recommended but installing GNU prolog on windows is just as simple

Then I just pasted the console output into a text file, manipulated it with regex to extract all the numbers and pasted that into https://onlinetoolz.net/sum#

Total was correct first try luckily

Part 2 was solved likewise using part2.pro

Used more regex and some sifting tools to get the sum of products
